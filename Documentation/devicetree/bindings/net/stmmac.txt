* STMicroelectronics 10/100/1000 Ethernet driver (GMAC)

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "snps,dwmac-<ip_version>" "snps,dwmac"
	For backwards compatibility: "st,spear600-gmac" is also supported.
- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupt-parent: Should be the phandle for the interrupt controller
  that services interrupts for this device
- interrupts: Should contain the STMMAC interrupts
- interrupt-names: Should contain the interrupt names "macirq"
  "eth_wake_irq" if this interrupt is supported in the "interrupts"
  property
- phy-mode: String, operation mode of the PHY interface.
  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "gmii", "rgmii". 
- snps,multicast-filter-bins:	Number of multicast filter hash bins
				supported by this device instance
- snps,perfect-filter-entries:	Number of perfect filter entries supported
				by this device instance

Optional properties:
- mac-address: 6 bytes, mac address
- snps,max-mtu          Maximum mtu size permitted. Useful since
                        the Synopsys EMAC transmit and receive fifos are
                        configurable by Core Consultant, resulting in
                        different maximum mtus for different instances
                        of the device.

Examples:

	gmac0: ethernet@e0800000 {
		compatible = "st,spear600-gmac";
		reg = <0xe0800000 0x8000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&vic1>;
		interrupts = <24 23>;
		interrupt-names = "macirq", "eth_wake_irq";
		mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */
		phy-mode = "gmii";
		snps,max-mtu = <4062>;
		snps,multicast-filter-bins = <256>;
		snps,perfect-filter-entries = <128>;
	};
