	---help---
	  If you have a network (Ethernet) card belonging to this class, say Y.
	  Make sure you know the name of your card. Read the Ethernet-HOWTO,
	  available from <http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto>.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question doesn't directly affect the
	  kernel: saying N will just cause the configurator to skip all
	  the remaining Blackfin card questions. If you say Y, you will be
	  asked for your specific card in the following questions.
