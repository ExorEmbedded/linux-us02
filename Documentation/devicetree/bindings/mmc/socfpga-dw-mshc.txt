* Altera SOCFPGA specific extensions to the Synopsis Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "altr,socfpga-dw-mshc": for controllers with Altera SOCFPGA
	  specific extentions.

* altr,dw-mshc-ciu-div: Specifies the divider value for the card interface
  unit (ciu) clock. The value should be (n-1). For Altera's SOCFPGA,
  the divider value is fixed at 3, which means parent_clock/4.

* altr,dw-mshc-sdr-timing: Specifies the value of CIU clock phase shift value
  in transmit mode and CIU clock phase shift value in receive mode for single
  data rate mode operation. Refer notes below for the order of the cells and the
  valid values.

  Notes for the sdr-timing values:

    The order of the cells should be
      - First Cell: CIU clock phase shift value for RX mode, smplsel bits in
	the system manager SDMMC control group.
      - Second Cell: CIU clock phase shift value for TX mode, drvsel bits in
	the system manager SDMMC control group.

    Valid values for SDR CIU clock timing for SOCFPGA:
      - valid value for tx phase shift and rx phase shift is 0 to 7.

Required properties for a slot:

* bus-width: Data width for card slot. 4-bit or 8-bit data.

Example:

  The MSHC controller node can be split into two portions, SoC specific and
  board specific portions as listed below.

	dwmmc0@ff704000 {
		compatible = "altr,socfpga-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0xff704000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 139 4>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};

	dwmmc0@ff704000 {
		num-slots = <1>;
		supports-highspeed;
		broken-cd;
		fifo-depth = <0x400>;
		altr,dw-mshc-ciu-div = <4>;
      		altr,dw-mshc-sdr-timing = <0 3>;

		slot@0 {
			reg = <0>;
			bus-width = <4>;
		};
	};
