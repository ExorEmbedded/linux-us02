/*
 * The secondary kernel init calls v7_flush_dcache_all before it enables
 * the L1; however, the L1 comes out of reset in an undefined state, so
 * the clean + invalidate performed by v7_flush_dcache_all causes a bunch
 * of cache lines with uninitialized data and uninitialized tags to get
 * written out to memory, which does really unpleasant things to the main
 * processor.  We fix this by performing an invalidate, rather than a
 * clean + invalidate, before jumping into the kernel.
 *
 * This funciton is cloned from arch/arm/mach-tegra/headsmp.S, and needs
 * to be called for both secondary cores startup and primary core resume
 * procedures.  Ideally, it should be moved into arch/arm/mm/cache-v7.S.
