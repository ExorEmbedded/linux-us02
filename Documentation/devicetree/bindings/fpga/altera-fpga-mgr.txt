Altera FPGA Manager

Required properties:

  - compatible : should be "<manufacturer>,<type>"
                 "altr,fpga-mgr-1.0", "altr,fpga-mgr";

  - transport  : the interface for register and configuration data.
                 Currently only memory mapped io is supported, so must be "mmio"

  - reg        : base address for memory mapped io.
                  - The first index is for FPGA manager register access.
                  - The second index is for writing FPGA configuration data.

  - interrupts : interrupts for the FPGA Manager device.

Example:

	hps_0_fpgamgr: fpgamgr@0xff706000 {
		compatible = "altr,fpga-mgr-1.0", "altr,fpga-mgr";
		transport = "mmio";
		reg = <0xFF706000 0x1000
		       0xFFB90000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 175 4>;
	};
