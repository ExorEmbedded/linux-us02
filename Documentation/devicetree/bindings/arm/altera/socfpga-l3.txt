Altera SOCFPGA L3 Interconnect (NIC-301)

Required properties:
- compatible : "altr,l3regs", "syscon";
                Note that syscon is invoked for this device to support the FPGA
		bridge driver and possibly other devices in the future.  See
		also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.txt
- reg : Should contain 1 register ranges(address and length)

Example:
	l3regs@0xff800000 {
		compatible = "altr,l3regs", "syscon";
		reg = <0xff800000 0x1000>;
	};
