Altera SOCFPGA SDRAM Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : "altr,sdr-ctl", "syscon";
                Note that syscon is invoked for this device to support the FPGA
		bridge driver and possibly other devices in the future.  See
		also Documentation/devicetree/bindings/mfd/syscon.txt
- reg : Should contain 1 register ranges(address and length)

Example:
	sdrctl@0xffc25000 {
		compatible = "altr,sdr-ctl", "syscon";
		reg = <0xffc25000 0x1000>;
	};
